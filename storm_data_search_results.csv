The front moved north and northwest through Prince William Sound and into the northern Susitna Valley Sunday midday.

 Gusts reached 73 mph at the Prince William Sound Science Center with frontal passage around noon Sunday.   Wind gusts at the southeast Sound buoy gusted in the 50 to 60 mph from 11 pm Saturday through 10 am Sunday.

In the western Prince William Sound zone, east wind gusts of 60 + mph were observed in the Portage Valley from around 1 am to just before 1 pm Sunday.  Peak winds reached 68 mph between 11 am and noon.   In the January 10th edition of the Anchorage Daily News, an article referred to storm totals Saturday night and Sunday of "...about 3 feet of wet snow..."which held 2 weekend campers and their dogs "captive" in a remote Forest Service cabin on the Kenai Peninsula on the northwest end of Crescent Lake.  "We got to the cabin (apparently late Saturday) and the winds started blowing" Rachel Cheyette said, continuing with "On Saturday night it blew all night long." On Sunday morning, the wind slowed and the couple started breaking trail through heavy wet snow for about a mile until everything turned white. "There were whiteout conditions", Cheyette stated.  When they couldn't see the trail, they hiked back to cabin to wait out the storm, aware that conditions had primed the slopes for avalanches.  They were finally rescued by helicopter midday Tuesday.  Several feet of new fell at higher elevations along Turnagain Pass.

Spotter reports from the State Troopers in Turnagain Pass were "4-5" of new snow and whiteout conditions as of 2:30 am".  By 1:45 pm, DOT officials reported 2.29 inches of rain from the storm around Girdwood, with snow in the Pass.  The report also mentioned 24" of new snow as of noon.  With the early morning observation, this yielded about 20 inches of snow in 9 ½ hours.   

Along the Anchorage hillside, peak winds of 60 + mph were first reported at the Glen Alps site around 6 am.  Between 7 and 8 am Sunday, winds increased above 60 mph at Rabbit Creek, with peak winds reaching 71 mph several hours later between 10 and 11 am.  The Glen Alps site recorded peak winds of 61 mph at 6 am and again at 10 pm.  Wind gusts below 60 mph were reported after 10 pm Sunday.  Much stronger winds, however, were recorded along the Site Summit remote sensor, at close to 4000 asl, adjacent to the old Nike Site near Arctic Valley ski area where gusts reached 79 mph at 5 am, 129 mph at 9 am and 103 mph just before 11 pm (winds diminished to well below 60 mph thereafter).  

Roads were dangerously slick Sunday, prompting the Alaska State Troopers to issue a travel advisory for the Seward Highway.  In Anchorage, police counted 81 vehicles in distress between midnight Saturday and 2 pm Sunday.  Many of them ended up in ditches or were stuck along the Glenn Highway and in Eagle River.  Anchorage police sent three extra officers to help out.  At the western entrance to Turnagain Arm, an avalanche was reported at Mile 98, on the Bird Flats north west of Girdwood, which set off four smaller slides that came down to the highway.",31

The avalanche buried Foster.  Frankson went for help.

Snowmachiners found foster through a signal emitted by his

precise location, and dug Foster out from about 3.5 to 4 feet of
hard packed snow.  At least 30 minutes had elapsed since the

third avalanche fatality in Alaska this winter.

weeks.  This mix of extreme cold, punctuated by several 'warm'
storms, has made the snowpack especially unstable, according to
avalanche experts.  On the bottom is a layer of very weak sugary
snow (faceted snow) that formed during the cold periods.  Above
that is heavier, denser snow that fell during the warmer periods,
and wind packed snow.  In between are thin layers of surface
hoarfrost and ice. Forecasts adequately reflected weather that

The low then moved northeast and dissipated by 9pm on the 23rd, but high pressure which had resided over eastern Russia moved east over western Alaska and into the Interior on the 23rd.  On the 22nd, a weather front associated with the low brought strong winds and local blizzards to the Alaska Range, and the low itself created strong winds and blizzards over Cape Romanzof on the west coast. Heavy snows were generated over the western and northern interior, and in the Alaska Range.  Ahead of the front over the interior southeast of Fairbanks, freezing rain fell over zone 226 and parts of zone 224. 

Winter Storm/Avalanche:
Zone 225 - Parks Highway mile 218 near Panorama Peak, just north of Cantwell and south of Denali National Park. Unofficial reports noted that the avalanche covered the highway for up to a quarter of a mile to a depth of 16 feet. The highway was closed for nearly 2 days. There were no deaths or injuries from this avalanche, though one truck with an empty propane trailer encountered the edge of the moving snow mass.  Snow fall amounts in the area of the avalanche were reported to be 12-16 inches by the D.O.T.  At the Denali Park Co-operative observing station, 7.5 inches of snow was recorded by 0800AST on the 23rd, with snow beginning around 0800 on the 22nd.  The avalanche knocked out power to the community of Cantwell for 6 to 8 hours on the 23rd, and in the Denali Park Entrance on the 23rd and into the 24th. The Parks Highway was closed at Panorama Peak most of the 23rd and the 24th. Land transportation of mail and goods was halted between Fairbanks and Anchorage, as the Richardson Highway from Delta Junction through Isabel Pass was noted to have treacherous driving conditions from the sleet, freezing rain, and blowing snow.  Blizzard conditions followed the heavy snowfall as north winds developed due to the high pressure over western Alaska moving into the interior.  This hampered quick removal of the snow on the Parks Highway.
Zone 226 - The Richardson Highway between Delta Junction and Paxson was closed on the 23rd and not reopened until the 26th due to large snow drifts from blowing snow. An avalanche occurred during this time at some point on the Richardson highway (inferred from a State of AK D.O.T. report on the 27th), though no injuries or damage occurred.

Freezing Rain was reported:
Zone 224 - 0.5 inches by the Tok Maintenance Station of the Alaska D.O.T, a combination of freezing rain, sleet, and snow.  The Alaska Highway was closed for a period of time.

An estimated $300 million in damage was reported from flooding along the Santa Clara and Virgin Rivers in Washington County. One man was killed in the flooding near Quail Creek Reservior and three people perished in avalanches. The Virgin River water level reached a 25-year high and the Santa Clara River rose above any previously recorded level. 30 homes were destroyed as the Santa Clara changed course and cut through a portion of the community. Approximately 20 more homes were significantly damaged during this record flood event. This storm system also brought heavy and wet snowfall to elevations above 8000 feet. Many avalanches occurred throughout the state following the storm. A large avalanche killed a snowboarder in Ephraim Canyon. East of Mount Pleasant, a slide took the life of a snowmobiler.
